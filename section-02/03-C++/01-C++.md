# History

C++ was first implement at Bell Labs in 1979 as "C with classes"
by Bjarne Stroustrup.

It was designed to keep the efficiency and low-level power of C
and add on Object-Oriented programming features such classes,
inheritance, and templates (generics).

It was renamed to C++ in 1983.

In our introduction to C++, we'll discuss **namespaces**, 
how to write classes and use inheritance, and C++'s
implementation of generics, **templates**.
