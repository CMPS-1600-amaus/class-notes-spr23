# History

C++ was first implement at Bell Labs in 1979 as "C with classes"
by Bjarne Stroustrup.

It was designed to keep the efficiency and low-level power of C
and add on Object-Oriented programming features such classes,
inheritance, and templates (generics).

It was renamed to C++ in 1983.

In our introduction to C++, we'll discuss **namespaces**, 
how to write classes and use inheritance, and C++'s
implementation of generics, **templates**.

## Namespaces

In C, all function names need to be unique. If we include multiple libraries which
have functions that share names, we get naming conflicts. It won't compile.

As a programmer, we can solve this by:

1. Editing the source code of one of the libraries to eliminate naming conflicts.
2. Not using one of the libraries.

Libraries developers avoid this issue by prepending or appending unique tokens to
their function names.

Example: [OpenGL](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL-Refpages/es3/)

In C++, we avoid these issues by using namespaces.

Example:

```C++
namespace universe {
    typedef struct point3D {
        double x;
        double y;
        double z;
    } point3D;

    typedef struct atom {
        point3D coords;
        char name[2];
    } atom;
}

int main() {
    universe::atom c = {"C", {0,0,0}};
}
```

alternatively

```C++
using namespace universe;
int main() {
    atom c = {"C", {0,0,0}};
}
```

# Object-Oriented Programming

Declaring a class in C++

```C++
using namespace std;
typedef struct point3D {
    double x;
    double y;
    double z;
} point3D;

class Atom {
    string name;
    point3D coords;

    public:
    Atom(string name, double x, double y, double z) {
        this->name = name;
        coords.x = x;
        coords.y = y;
        coords.z = z;
    }

    void print() {
        cout << "Element: " << this->name << endl;
    }
}; // class definitions end in a semicolon
```

We can write classes all in a single file, but we typically split them
into two files: the **header** and the **source**.

The **header** contains the class definition (includes attributes and
methods), and the **source** contains the implementations.
