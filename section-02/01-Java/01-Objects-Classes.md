# Objects and Classes

An **object** is most generally a set of attributes and methods to interact with them.

An **class** is the definition for its objects. Its where we define the attributes and implement the methods.

Starting point for writing a class:

1) What are the *relevant* attributes?
2) What functions do we *need*?
