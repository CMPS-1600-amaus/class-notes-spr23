# Software Development

```
Maintainable
Readable
Well-tested
Compile
```

By readablility, we should write programs that are as simple an clear as possible. 

My maintainability, we should not only be able to debug our programs, but to also be able to easily add to and adapt the features of our programs.

# Documentation

We document our programs in two ways:

1) Doc Comments
2) UML Diagrams

## Doc Comments

Javadoc comments are specially formatted comments that you put at the top of your classes and at the top of every function.

## UML Diagrams

UML Diagrams illustrate the class organization of a program and concisely list class functions.
