# Data Structures

Abstractly, there is this idea of **Abstract Data Type**. An ADT defines the structure, operations, and sometimes the runtimes for those operations. 

A **Data Structure** is an object that stores data and provides operations for accessing and modifying that data.

A Data Structure is a realized implementation of an ADT.

Why study data structures?

Different data structures have different runtimes for their fundamental operations. They have different strengths and weaknesses.

By being familiar with several of them, you can choose the right one for the job based on desired behavior and/or runtimes.

We'll discuss Stacks, Queues, Heaps, and Hash Tables.
