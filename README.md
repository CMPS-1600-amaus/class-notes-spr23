# CMPS 1600 Notes and Examples

This repository holds our lecture notes and programming examples and
will be continuously updated throughout the semester.

You can browse this code in this repository online. You can download it
to your machine to experiment with yourself.

Lecture notes will be written in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
which you will be able to directly view through the github interface.

## Interacting with the Notes Locally

In lecture, we will regularly code programming examples. I highly
recommend that you experiment and play with these examples yourself.

The easiest way to do so is to use [Visual Studio
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). If you are not familiar with it, VS Code is just a fancy and highly functional code editor.

VS Code natively supports jupyter notebooks and git. Using VS Code,
you can "clone" a git repository and then open any of our jupyter
notebook files. 

### Cloning a Repository

To clone a repository, you need to

1) Copy the clone link from github
2) Clone the repository using this link in VS Code

On the github page for this respository, you can find the clone link
by clicking on the gree "Code" button. Use the HTTPS link unless you
want to or have set up SSH Authentication.

After copying the link, click "Clone Repository" from the "Explorer"
or "Source Control" tabs on the left hand side of VS Code. Paste
the link and clone the repository.

Once cloned, you can than see and interact with any of the files in
this repository.

### Updating the Notes

After every lecture, I will push the latest changes to our notes to
github. Once I do this, you can pull them down to your computer.

From the "Source Control" tab, click on the ellipsis at the top of the
source control pane. Click "Pull" and the latest changes will be 
downloaded to your machine.

## About Git

Git is what's known as a version control system and is used throughout
the software development industry. Git's purpose is to allow for remote
collaboration on large codebases (and small!). It was originally written
for the maintenance of the linux kernel. 

In recent years it has been a huge enabler of open source development.
Start listening to [The Changelog
Podcast](https://changelog.com/podcast) and you'll hear git and
[GitHub](https://github.com) come up again and again.

Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) and
