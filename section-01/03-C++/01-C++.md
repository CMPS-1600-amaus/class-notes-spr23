# History

C++ was first implemented in 1979 as "C with classes" bu Bjarne Stroustrup at
Bell Labs.

It was designed to keep the efficiency and low-level power of C and add
on add-on Object-Oriented programming features such as classes, inheritance,
and templates (generics).

It was renamed C++ in 1983. *The C++ Programming Language* was published in 1985.

In comparison to other high level languages like Java and Python, C++
is more efficient because of its lack of a garbage collector. It is up
to the programmers to correctly and efficiently manage their memory.

In our brief introduction to C++, we'll discuss **namespaces**,
how to write classes and use inheritance, and C++'s implementation
of generics called **templates**.

# Namespaces

C++ does not have "packages" like java.

We can include libraries, but this is a raw import of all classes and functions
in those librarys.

Java packages are hierarchical. We have `adventure_game.items.HealingPotion`.

The package is part of the identifier for HealingPotion so if we have a HealingPotion in
another package, we can distinctly refer to it through its package.

Library includes, on the other hand are flat. There is no hiearchical information
or unique identifiers.

In C/C++, we can't include any libraries which have functions that have identical names.

If we end up with naming conflicts.

In C, MAJOR PROBLEMN. What do we do?

As a programmer, we have two choices:

1. edit the source code to eliminate naming conflicts

2. only use one of the libraries

No. Good.

The hack among library developers is to make their function names unique by prepending
or appending some unique token to them.

Example [OpenGL](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL-Refpages/es3/)

**Namespaces** allows us to place classes and functions under some specific name in order
to avoid naming conflicts

To create a namespace, we create a namespace block and put our features within it.

```C++
namespace universe
{
    typedef struct point3D {
        double x;
        double y;
        double z;
    } point3D;

    typedef struct atom {
        char* name;
        point3D coords;
    } atom;
}

int main() {
    universe::atom c = {"c", {0, 0, 0}};
}
```

alternatively:

```C++
using namespace universe;
int main() {
    atom c = {"c", {0, 0, 0}};
}
```

## strings!

Strings are defined in the `std` namespace and including 
`length`, `substr`, and `compare`.

# Object-Oriented Programming

Declaring a class in C++

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
typedef struct point3D {
    double x;
    double y;
    double z;
} point3D;

class Atom {
    string name;
    point3D coords;

    public:

    Atom(string name, double x, double y, double z) {
        this->name = name;
        coords.x = x;
        coords.y = y;
        coords.z = z;
    }

    void print() {
        cout << "Element: " << this->name << endl;
    }
}; // class definitions end in a semicolon

int main() {
    Atom* c = new Atom("C", 0, 0, 0);
    c->print();
}
``` 

We can write classes all in a single file, but we typically split them
into two files: the **header** and the **source**.

The **header** contains the class definition (includes attributes and methods)
and the **source** contains all method implementations.
