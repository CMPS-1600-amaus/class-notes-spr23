# History

C++ was first implemented in 1979 as "C with classes" bu Bjarne Stroustrup at
Bell Labs.

It was designed to keep the efficiency and low-level power of C and add
on add-on Object-Oriented programming features such as classes, inheritance,
and templates (generics).

It was renamed C++ in 1983. *The C++ Programming Language* was published in 1985.

In comparison to other high level languages like Java and Python, C++
is more efficient because of its lack of a garbage collector. It is up
to the programmers to correctly and efficiently manage their memory.

In our brief introduction to C++, we'll discuss **namespaces**,
how to write classes and use inheritance, and C++'s implementation
of generics called **templates**.

# Namespaces

C++ does not have "packages" like java.

We can include libraries, but this is a raw import of all classes and functions
in those librarys.

Java packages are hierarchical. We have `adventure_game.items.HealingPotion`.

The package is part of the identifier for HealingPotion so if we have a HealingPotion in
another package, we can distinctly refer to it through its package.

Library includes, on the other hand are flat. There is no hiearchical information
or unique identifiers.

In C/C++, We can't include any libraries which have functions that have identical names.
