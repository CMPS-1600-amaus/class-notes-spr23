## Primitives

Primitive types are the most basic types in java. These are types that are built into the language and not defined by some class:

Examples:

- int
- long
- float
- double
- char

variables that are primitive types hold a single value.

## Reference Types

Reference types are any type that is defined by a class.

Variables that are reference types will refer to objects.

## Wrapper Classes

Wrapper classes exist for all primitives in Java. An object is of the type of one of these wrapper classes will store a primitive of the appropriate type and give us methods to interact or process it in various ways.

Example: [class Integer](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html)
