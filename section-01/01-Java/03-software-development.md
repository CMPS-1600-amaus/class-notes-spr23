We strive to write programs that are well-tested, readable, and maintainable. By maintainability, we should be able to easily debug our programs, but also easily add to and adapt the features of our program.

We achieve readable and maintainable code by clear and simple code, but also by documenting that code.

## Documentation

We both comment (especially doc comments) our programs and provide diagrams (UML) where necessary for them.
