We strive to write programs that are well-tested, readable, and maintainable. By maintainability, we should be able to easily debug our programs, but also easily add to and adapt the features of our program.

We achieve readable and maintainable code by clear and simple code, but also by documenting that code.

## Documentation

We both comment (especially doc comments) our programs and provide diagrams (UML) where necessary for them.

## Unit Testing

Unit Testing is a methodology of building out test functions so that you can **automatically** test your programs.

With a set of unit tests, you can verify that your entire program (because you've written tests for the whole thing) works after every modification of it. This frees you to make big changes as necessary.

### Writing Unit Tests

We write a test class for every class in our project. The test class consists of test methods for the methods of that class.
