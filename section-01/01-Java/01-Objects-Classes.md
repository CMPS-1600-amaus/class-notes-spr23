# Objects and Classes

An **object** is most generally a set of data and methods to interact with it.

A **class** is the definition for its objects. Its where we define the variables and implement the functions.

Starting point for writing a class:

1) What is the *relevant* data?
2) What functions do we *need*?

## Constructors

Constructors are special functions whose job it is to initialize all **instance variables**.

**Instance variables** are those attributes which every object gets its own copy of.
