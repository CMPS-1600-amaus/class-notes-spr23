# Data Structures

A **data structure** is an object which stores data and provides operations for accessing and modifying that data.

We have different data structures which achieve different efficiencies on these operations.

Our goal in learning about data structures is the ability to be able to choose the right one for the right job based off of efficiencies and/or behaviors.
